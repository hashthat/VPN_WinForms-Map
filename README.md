(Q=Question, A=Answer)
Assignment -- In ~1 page, describe the following:
Q) What type of game would it be (platformer, block breaker, fortress, endless runner, etc.)?
A) -- For this project, I developed a VPN application that shows the persons Geolocation through a javascript map using CSS and HTML JavaScript in a C# winforms application. I had the vision and still wanted to have this project feel more complete. So, that is what i did. I guess that's what was exciting. If I actually created a game with this there are possibilities for creating a multiplayer game of risk. I guess technically I would not have to use a VPN but using Google Maps or a "real world" map, the game design could be unique and very cool. But right now, i have an application that shares your VPN location on the map as a way to see where a person is logged in or located at given their IP Address.
Q) What type of background/character/enemy art would you need? Do you need to create it or can you find most of it through royalty free sites?
A) -- I have experience with Game Development, maybe that's part of why I went with a VPN. But I can get free resources online for developing any type of game. For a game developer there are characters and animations someone can piece together through FBX files at https://www.mixamo.com/ -- I've done some shadowing. 
A)--  One of the games I've developed in the past is a VR Zombie Shooter Game.    • ZombieDemo   -- It was definitely fun to create. But the zombies are Mixamo assets, along with the handgun! I was surprised! But, If I were to redevelop a game it would be a VRZombie Shooter or a Mobile Platformer game with a basic scoring system for an easy game experience.
Q) What is the objective of the game?
A) -- The objective of my VPN app is to see where your IP Address is showing up in the world! -- kind of exciting.
Q) What obstacles are in the way of meeting that objective?
A) -- Currently my obstical is the update button. The rendering in the application doesn't update with the new IP Address. But, the application can be reset and it shows the proper location after reloading the app!
Q) What metrics are you bound by (player movement, speed, size of player, enemies, jumping, collisions/interactions, etc.)?
A) -- So, given my application isn't a game, the limitations would be how much the application can load given data and etc. But, a person is limited to a FreeVPN unless they go out and get their own online. The functionality of the map, anyone can browse and explore the countries surrounding the area, zoom in and out, change location and by resetting the application update the location to a new country using their vpn! I did imagine a cool animation using a top down wonderer of the MAP.
Q) What does the game’s macro design require from this level?
A) -- A good world map (I have that) and a good backend to run the code. but, efficient code along with the idea. I'm sure there are other things someone could use a VPN location and map for.
Q) Using lateral thinking (destroying assumptions, thinking backward, or using the random word idea generator), what creative twists will you include to increase the novelty and playability?
A) -- I actually created a random VPN generator. That's a simple task someone can do, I also tried making a web scraper for when https://www.vpnbook.com/ updates the password. There are certain network errors that arose a few times where I had to re-route, take a step back and simplify the application for the functionality to work properly. But, I had fun creating a functioning map!
